## How to Use

Below is detailed guidance on how to configure and use the User Model Interact Action.

### Overview

The User Model Interact Action provides an abstraction layer for maintaining a user model based on conversational exchanges. It supports multiple configurations for various use cases, including:

- **User profiling** based on conversational history.
- **Integration** with other actions to adapt the system to user-specific needs.

---

### Configuration Structure

The configuration consists of the following components:

### `user_model_template`

Defines the initial structure of the user model.

```python
user_model_template = "**User Model:**\n- **Personal Information and Demographics:**\n- **Preferences and Interests:**"
```

### `anchors`

Defines the key areas of focus for user profiling.

```python
anchors = [
    "The user shares personal information and demographics",
    "The user shares preferences and interests",
    "The user shares behavioral patterns and habits",
    "The user shares personal opinions, values, or beliefs",
    "The user shares goals and needs",
    "Mentions of relationships with family, friends, or colleagues"
]
```

### Example Configurations

### Basic Configuration for User Model Interact Action

]
history_size = 3
model_name = "gpt-4o"
